# shfmt configuration aligning with style guide preferences
# 2-space indentation, indent switch/case, simplify redirects

# Notes:
# - shfmt does not enforce 80 char line length or pipeline splitting.
# - Use editor rulers or an additional linter if strict line length needed.
# - Keep this file minimal so tooling (pre-commit, scripts) picks it up automatically.
