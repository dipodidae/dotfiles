# ShellCheck configuration approximating enforceable parts of the Google Shell Style Guide.
#
# Notes:
#  - ShellCheck does NOT enforce formatting (indentation, line length, pipeline layout). Use shfmt + custom scripts.
#  - Many style guide items (function header comments, main() placement, avoiding large scripts) require human/code review.
#  - Exclusions below are for interactive/zsh oriented config snippets where ShellCheck would otherwise be noisy.
#  - We keep severity at 'style' to surface everything; CI still fails on any non-excluded finding.
#
# HOW THIS FILE IS USED
#  The lint scripts and CI export SHELLCHECK_OPTS from the cleaned (non-comment) lines of this file.
#  Each non-comment token below is passed as a flag to shellcheck.

shell=bash
severity=style
external-sources=true
color=always

# ------------------------- EXCLUSIONS (document rationale) -------------------------
# SC1071: zsh-specific (interactive config uses zsh syntax but parsed as bash for baseline lint)
# SC1090: dynamic/optional source paths in user env (.zshrc optional modules)
# SC2034: unused vars (common in shell config exports / prompts)
# SC2086: intentional word splitting in a few helper functions; reviewed for safety
# SC2119: function called with no args (acceptable for some wrappers)
# SC2120: function defined with parameters but called without (interactive convenience)
# SC2155: declare and assign in one line; acceptable for concise prompt/env setup
# SC2164: ignoring 'cd' failure acceptable in interactive navigation helpers
# SC2207: command substitution to array in zsh context (acceptable & clear here)
disable=SC1071,SC1090,SC2034,SC2086,SC2119,SC2120,SC2155,SC2164,SC2207

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To fineâ€‘tune: remove an exclusion above and fix resulting warnings; keep list minimal.
# For per-line suppressions prefer an inline directive over broad exclusion when practical:
#   # shellcheck disable=SCxxxx
